<h1>The Best Movies According to Jolene</h1>
<h2>My Top Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>I recently saw this film and it instantly became one of my favorites.</p>
<h3>Bridget Jones Diary</h3>
<p>
  Perhaps this film doesn't stand the test of time, but I have related so much
  with this quirky singleton.
</p>
<h3>All About Eve</h3>
<p>
  Such a classic tale, an aging star crosses paths with an ambitious ingenue.
  Bette Davis has an onscreen presence that is larger than life and doesn't age.
